                                    <p>A great place to stay. The highlights were the media room and the double bunk bed room. A huge plus for anyone traveling with kids. Zip line is very cool and the hosts are exceedingly accommodating and super quick with communications. The very nice neighborhood in the hills also felt very safe while being very close to the downtown draws.</p>

                            <p>Finally a nice and clean, well maintained lake home close to Sioux Falls at a reasonable price! Take a 30 minute drive to Lake Vermillion and see this A frame lake home built in 1984 with a full tuck under garage. The view of Lake Vermillion is Soothing and Peaceful and where memories are made. What a way to spend the weekends, vacations or year around. This home has had updates including siding, windows and recently HVAC and shingles. Possibly build another structure since the property includes lots 13, 14 and 15. The house sits on lot 15. Serviced by septic, propane and TM Rural Water with a cistern as bonus. Lake Vermillion is a 512-acre reservoir is located 27 miles west of Sioux Falls and is easily accessible off I-90. It has become a popular lake among fishermen, boaters and swimmers. The lake has a strong population of walleye, northern pike, crappie and blue gill. There are two boat ramps on the lake and a fishing pier. Owner is a licensed real estate agent in SD.</p>

                            <p>This is truly one to see! You will not find anything like this custom built house with character & class while being functional & fun. Located in desirable Tomar area, this five level home will leave you dreaming of making it your own. The kitchen/dining overlooks the large vaulted living room w/ an incredible amount of natural light. You can't help but be happy here! A highlight is the sunroom... wall & ceiling windows will make this a favorite spot. The vaulted upper level houses the primary suite complete with a large bedroom, bath with tub & shower as well as another bedroom perfect for a nursery/office. The lowest level feels as bright as the main with a walkout & a 2nd fireplace. The backyard is phenomenal... it's like you are living in a tree house. It's large with beautiful trees & no backyard neighbors except wildlife like turkey & deer. Don't miss the hidden playhouse! And to top it off, the garage is huge (nearly 4 stalls) w/ a core floor storage room & workshop. A must see!</p>

                                    <p>Great spot with beautiful backdrop! Our family with 2 young kids and the grandmas stayed here. Kathryn made us feel very welcome like family. The zipline was awesome and enjoyed by most of our group, including my 3 year old tandem zipping, and the grown-ups night zipping. Very comfortable family friendly home with so many toys, books, and instruments. Parents enjoyed a movie in the theater room after kids in bed. Easiest family trip as the littles had plenty to keep themselves busy right at the house without needing to bring so much extra gear from home. Grandmas could have used a higher couch or comfy chair, but overall worked really well for our wide range of ages. Thanks and we plan to come again!!</p>
